# Grid Process Overview

This document provides an overview of the workflow designed in **ProcessMaker** for **Project_C**. The process consists of multiple tasks, with forms and grids for data input and review.

## Process Workflow

The following diagram represents the overall structure of the workflow, including two sections that guide the user from the initial task to the final task. Each grid represents a step in the process.
